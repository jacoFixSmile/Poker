# Poker local
## Description
A poker game created to run locally on a phone without internet access. 
As part of this excerise we try to minimize the amount of package/frameworks we use to get to the end result. For every package we explain why we use it so we don't create a wild grow from packages:
* axios: for API access between back and front-end
* express: to render the front-end pages
* socket: to make the game interactive. Tutorial https://socket.io/docs/v4/tutorial/step-3
SQLITE https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html https://blog.logrocket.com/using-built-in-sqlite-module-node-js/
